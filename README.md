ModelGenerator
==============

A simple tool to generate Minecraft 1.8 JSON models.

Run it with rdmd, or compile it and drop the executable in /usr/bin.
You can get dmd (Digital Mars D) [here](http://dlang.org/download.html).
Works on Mac, untested on Windows and Linux. If you want to make cool block and item shapes (anything other than simple items and cubes), look at the vanilla models as this tool does not support these.
